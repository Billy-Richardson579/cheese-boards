Plan after installing npm packages 

1. make a models directory and a database directory with a connection.js file which will initalise sequlize
   - Models User , Board and Cheese and a database dir called db and will contain connection.js and the .sqlite file
   - dont complete the models yet
   - commit and push to github repo


2. Make the tests for the models in a new dir called tests
    - make a new dir called testes
    - test each model can use .create correctly and returns the desired result
    - commit and push to github repo

3. Complete models and add there relationships in a index.js file on the root of the project 
    - complete the models by adding the datatypes of each model eg name:DataTypes.STRING
    - make a index.js file in the modules folder this will export all the modules together 
    - touch a index.js file to the root of the project this is where the relationships of each module will be defined 
    - define relationships
    - commit and push to github 

4. Write the tests that will show that the relationships are working
    - A board can be loaded with its cheeses
    - A user can be loaded with its boards
    - A cheese can be loaded with its board data
